Here you will find an exhaustive list of experiments made with GraphX.

Some are more complicated than others, but overall is a good resource to learn the "real world" API that GraphX provides.

Be WARNED: the examples are (mostly) pretty raw, a direct copy of codes I did during the last couple of months as
quick prototypes for experiments while sketching the package. 

Remember, GraphX should be considered WIP. As stated in the root README file, I mostly used it to play, prototype
and have fun creating random stuffs, and that's the spirit of it :)

Although you are free to use it in production apps (some users are, myself as well), beware that you might find 
some bugs, even more in this null-safety branch.

I truly hope you enjoy using the package, as I much as I do.

Sincerely, roipeker.
